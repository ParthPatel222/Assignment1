They provide academic guidance in order to keep you on track for graduation\n                                    and can help connect you to campus programs and services. You are assigned an academic\n                                    advisor, or advising center, based on your intended major.\nWe encourage you to meet with your advisor at least once each semester. Advising is\n                                    not registration! You should meet with your advisor prior to the date you register\n                                    for classes so you can discuss the best plan for the upcoming semester and beyond.\nAcademic Advising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I find out who my advisor is?\n\n\n\nYou are assigned an advisor based on your intended major. Exploratory/undecided students\n                                                   are seen by Owl Advising, and students who have a major already identified are seen\n                                                   by the advisors in that department. In many cases, your advisor will be viewable in\n                                                   DegreeWorks. You can find more advising information by visiting https://advising.kennesaw.edu/who.php\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I know when it’s time to register each semester?\n\n\nThe best way to plan ahead is to access the phased registration dates on the Registrar’s site. If these are not up to date, you can also click on the academic calendar to view\n                                                many important dates for the University including the beginning and ending of each\n                                                phase of registration. The first available time for you to register can be found by\n                                                logging into Owl Express.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I change my major?\n\n\nYou can change/declare your major in Owl Express under the “student records” tab in Owl Express.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat classes are required for my major?\n\n\n\nEach major has a specific list of required classes for graduation. Current KSU students\n                                                   should check DegreeWorks for this list.\nDegreeWorks is a web-based tool through Banner Web that provides real-time information\n                                                   on degree progression. DegreeWorks lists the courses you are required to take to complete\n                                                   your degree at KSU. This is available to you 24/7.\nLogin to Owl Express (enter your KSU ID & Pin) Select the Student menu. Select DegreeWorks – Degree Audit.\nYour declared major worksheet will automatically load. There is also a “WHAT-IF” tab that gives you an unofficial view of how your credits will apply to a different major. (NOTE: If you officially change your major, you will be moved to the most recent Catalog regardless of when you started classes at KSU.)\nDegreeWorks does not replace face to face advising. You should continue to meet with\n                                                   your advisor to discuss degree-related concerns. Prospective students should contact\n                                                   the major department of interest for degree information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I find out about financial aid?\n\n\nInformation on financial aid, including loans, FAFSA, Hope, and work-study opportunities,\n                                                can be found online at the KSU Financial Aid site.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I find out about scholarship opportunities?\n\n\n\nYour department may be aware of additional scholarships related to your field of study.\n                                                   In addition, the KSU library contains books with information with various scholarships and grants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there someone I can talk to about different career options?\n\n\nThe Department of Career Planning and Development would be a great place to start. Additionally, the Counseling and Psychological Services Center conducts career and academic counseling. Finally, your advisors can help you see\n                                                how your undergraduate major can lead you to many different careers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFIND YOUR INTEREST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture & Construction Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing & Software Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering & Engineering Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanities & Social Sciences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Human Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience & Mathematics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Info\n\n\n\nKennesaw Campus1000 Chastain RoadKennesaw, GA 30144\nMarietta Campus1100 South Marietta PkwyMarietta, GA 30060\nCampus Maps\n\n\nPhone470-KSU-INFO(470-578-4636)\nkennesaw.edu/info\nMedia Resources\n\n\n\n\n\nResources For\n\n\nCurrent Students\nOnline Only Students\nFaculty & Staff\nParents & Family\nAlumni & Friends\nCommunity & Business\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\n\n\nLibraries\nHousing\nFinancial Aid\nDegrees, Majors & Programs\nRegistrar\nJob Opportunities\n\n\n\n\nCampus Security\nGlobal Education\nDiverse & Inclusive Excellence\nSustainability\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow KSU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636)\n© 2023 Kennesaw State University.

No matter where you choose to visit us, we hope you’ll love Kennesaw State University as much as we do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Success\n\nPossessing computer skills and feeling comfortable online does not necessarily ensure\n                                    your success in an online course. A common theme in online courses is self-discipline\n                                    and persistence. At Kennesaw State, we are committed to helping our online students\n                                    achieving their academic best.\nOnline Student Success\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of online learning?\n\n\n\nOnline learning provides considerable freedom, allowing students to often choose when and where they'll participate in class activities. \n\nSave time and money spent commuting to a campus\nContinue working at your current job while you are taking classes\nAttend your class from anywhere as long as you have a high-speed Internet connection\nLearn at your own pace and study at your convenience\nLearn new technologies\nInteract on equal footing\n\nStudents will have the same kinds of deadlines and structured responsibilities of\n                                                   a face-to-face class. In other words, flexibility must be balanced by responsibility.\n                                                   Like a face-to-face course, online courses require assignments be completed by due\n                                                   dates, your attendance (via logins to your course), involvement in online discussions,\n                                                   and sometimes group collaboration. Most students enjoy the active learning that online\n                                                   classes involve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the challenges of online learning?\n\n\n\nSelf-motivation and discipline are required to succeed in distance learning courses.\n                                                   For many, distance learning offers access to education not previously available. It\n                                                   also provides a solution to flexibility needs, work and travel responsibilities, and\n                                                   family challenges.\nA successful experience in distance learning requires a basic familiarity with technology. Resources are available for students through University Information Technology Services for those interested in distance learning, but in need of a technology refresher. It is also strongly recommended that students have ready access to a computer or laptop with a high-speed Internet access, such as DSL or cable broadband. Online courses will require students to download and access course materials. Online learning success depends on preparation, motivation, dedication, and planning. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat equipment and technology will I need to be successful at online learning? \n\n\n\nOnline learners will need a computer, Internet access, basic software (such as Microsoft\n                                                   Office Suite, Windows Media Player, Quicktime movie player, anti-virus protection\n                                                   and a compatible browser), and auxiliary equipment (such as a webcam and microphone\n                                                   headset for video-based communication). Of course, technology needs will vary by course.\n                                                   But this list applies to the majority of courses.\n\nComputer: Online Learners will need reliable access to a desktop or laptop computer that has\n                                                      adequate memory and processing capabilities for large file downloads, video players,\n                                                      and synchronous meeting applications.\nAuxiliary Equipment: The Digital Learning Innovations team also strongly recommends a WebCam and Headset\n                                                      for video-based communication. Many newer laptop or monitor set-ups are pre-equipped.\n                                                      These items may be required by faculty on a course-by-course basis.\nInternet Access: Online courses at KSU use the web to deliver courses at a distance. So, to learn\n                                                      in an online course smoothly, you need a high-speed Internet connection (such as DSL,\n                                                      Broadband, etc).

The Know More, Borrow Less (KMBL) initiative supports the USG’s three primary objectives: graduate more students, be more affordable and be more efficient. This initiative is designed to reduce barriers to aid, improve students’ understanding of borrowing and reduce student debt.\nTo support this initiative, a “debt letter” will be electronically sent in a mobile-friendly format to every enrolled student who currently has student loan debt resulting from federal or state loan programs, or private lender borrowing. Students will receive both a text and an email providing them a link to a personalized letter containing specific information on monthly payments based on their current loan amounts. Each academic year, students will receive a debt letter, updating them on their cumulative student loan debt.

After graduation, I was able to join a young and rapidly-growing cybersecurity firm in the Atlanta area, which allowed me to quickly jump into the world of consulting. This was all thanks to connections I formed during my time at KSU. I've since been able to grow into a full-time career as a penetration tester and red teamer, helping organizations secure their critical assets and helping to reduce business risk.\nMy experiences from the CYBR program have been extremely valuable during this entire process. The technical and managerial concepts taught in the courses aided me in multiple real-world settings and projects. Additionally, I’d argue that the extracurricular opportunities at KSU, such as the Offensive Security club and SECCDC competition, are key differentiators for the program, and are nearly equal to the value of an entire undergraduate degree in themselves.\nIf you are local to the Atlanta area, it’s also worth noting the extremely advantageous location that KSU possesses. The Atlanta technology sector is growing rapidly, with many large organizations in the city seeking talented individuals from universities like KSU.\n\n\n\n\nMadison Loewe, BS in Cybersecurity Class of 2021\nKennesaw State University alumna Madison Loewe graduated summa cum laude in Spring\n                                    2021. For her graduating class, she was recognized as the Cybersecurity Student of\n                                    the Year. This honor had been noticed by Risk3sixty, and they reached out to Loewe\n                                    about an interview. While going through the interview process, she noticed that she\n                                    enjoyed talking to the team and reading their content online and determined that this\n                                    was the place for her. Soon after, Loewe was an Associate at Risk3sixty and worked\n                                    within the GRC space with their SOC 2 team. The material she had learned throughout\n                                    her college journey had been integral to understanding the work she would be doing\n                                    and preparing her to face the challenges of cybersecurity. In her role, she is continuously\n                                    learning and growing as she interacts with many aspects of the cybersecurity field,\n                                    from configurations to vendor management to penetration test reports, with many different\n                                    business models. By April of 2022, she had been promoted to Senior Associate. Since\n                                    then, Loewe has published content related to the SOC 2 attestation process, begun\n                                    participating in a book club for professional development, and been studying for certifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Connected to Cyber Institute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIND YOUR INTEREST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture & Construction Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing & Software Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering & Engineering Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanities & Social Sciences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Human Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience & Mathematics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Info\n\n\n\nKennesaw Campus1000 Chastain RoadKennesaw, GA 30144\nMarietta Campus1100 South Marietta PkwyMarietta, GA 30060\nCampus Maps\n\n\nPhone470-KSU-INFO(470-578-4636)\nkennesaw.edu/info\nMedia Resources\n\n\n\n\n\nResources For\n\n\nCurrent Students\nOnline Only Students\nFaculty & Staff\nParents & Family\nAlumni & Friends\nCommunity & Business\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\n\n\nLibraries\nHousing\nFinancial Aid\nDegrees, Majors & Programs\nRegistrar\nJob Opportunities\n\n\n\n\nCampus Security\nGlobal Education\nDiverse & Inclusive Excellence\nSustainability\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow KSU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636)\n© 2023 Kennesaw State University.

Making the record attendance more significant was the\n                     number of students who came out to cheer the Owls to victory.\n\nResearch has shown that students who are engaged in campus life outside the classroom\n                     are more likely to have success in their courses, and KSU leaders have made it a priority\n                     to provide enriching experiences to encourage student involvement.\nMore than half of Thursday’s crowd at the home opener were students, a record attendance of 5,415. Of those, about 2,000 were first-year students who ran across the field to start the game dressed in their FLIGHT27 jerseys. Launched in 2022, the FLIGHT: Class-Year Connections program is one of the University’s larger student-engagement initiatives that fosters a sense of community among members of each incoming class of students to form bonds that help them succeed through each year and graduate together four years later.\n\n\n– Photos by Matt Yung, John Brogan and Judith Pishnery\n\n\n\n\nRelated StoriesMarching Owls take advantage of transitional football season for Kennesaw StateRenovated Kennesaw State Marietta Campus rec center reopensFun programs have serious purpose to engage Kennesaw State studentsKennesaw State program offers community, adventure in the great outdoorsA leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 43,000 students.

We're all transitioning for a year, and we'll all be ready next year when we move into a new conference.”\nThe Marching Owls have an all-time high 280 musicians representing every major on campus. In his second year as director, Meeks said he wants to enhance the program to ensure optimal crowd engagement. That starts with the early moments of game day—and the band’s march from its facility on Busbee Drive to the stadium.\n“Our parade to the stadium will be more of a performance than just an event,” he said. “We’ll stop and play at different tailgating spots along the way. We’ll go into the stadium later than we usually do, because when you see the band coming into the stadium, we want you to know it’s game time. We’re ready, and our students are ready.”\n\nOnce inside the stadium, the band will play “Georgia on My Mind,” which moves from its traditional spot between the third and fourth quarters. Meeks said alumni and students love the song enough to want to hear it at games, but that it belonged in another moment. After that, they’ll play “The Star-Spangled Banner” and then take their seats behind the visitors’ bench, another opportunity to make their presence felt. He said the band will experiment with various short songs relevant to the game action—if it works, they’ll keep it in the program. If not, they’ll try something else in another game.\n“We have to unrelentingly support our football team,” he said. “I want to create a true home field advantage and that means being loud and proud.”\nBeyond that, Meeks said KSU football fans would have to attend the games to see what the Marching Owls have in store. He did offer the hint that the Marching Owls seek to build momentum as KSU joins Conference USA starting with the 2024-25 academic year. The men’s basketball team’s appearance in the 2023 NCAA Tournament started that momentum of crowd engagement, as the strains of the Owls’ war chant (“You don’t want to go to war/With the Owls, with the Owls”) still ring in thousands of ears.\n“The nice thing about Kennesaw State is we have an opportunity here to establish some traditions,” Meeks said. “The Marching Owls are here to be a symbol for KSU, and we want to engage the crowd and create a truly amazing game day experience.”\n– Dave Shelles\nPhotos by Matthew Yung and Judith Pishnery\n\n\n\n\nRelated StoriesRecord Kennesaw State football crowd reflects student-engagement successRenovated Kennesaw State Marietta Campus rec center reopensFun programs have serious purpose to engage Kennesaw State studentsKennesaw State leaders welcome faculty and staff for new academic yearA leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 43,000 students.

When students can connect with each other, it’s powerful. This provides that. This is a beautiful facility and very exciting day to reopen it.”\nThe Marietta rec center has been around for more than 20 years, but it officially\n                     shut its doors in October 2022 for a refresh. Immediate tasks included installing\n                     a new heating-cooling and ventilation system and some electrical upgrades. After that,\n                     through multiple focus groups, students provided ideas of what they wanted in the\n                     fitness center.\nExecutive Director for Sports and Recreation Tara Parker said students’ top wish was more space for weights and conditioning, as well as more group fitness classes and some outdoor adventure activities.\nThe project also included bringing in new fitness equipment, treadmills, ellipticals,\n                     free weights, weight machines, plus updating the area known as the Strength Arcade\n                     to allow more Olympic-style lifting for students. There is also a new turf-covered\n                     area where students can pull a sled or flip tires, which is unique to the Marietta\n                     rec center compared to the Kennesaw Campus rec center.\nAssistant Director for Marketing and Member Services Brittany Booth said streaming\n                     services have been added so students can attend a group fitness class in person or\n                     participate from home.\n“Our mission was to create engagement and opportunities for students to learn lifelong healthy habits they can take beyond their college career, as well as build an affinity for Kennesaw State,” Booth said.\nDuring the renovation, the Health Clinic was relocated, and the space it formerly\n                     held in the rec center is now a lounging area for students.\n“It’s an area where students can come and study,” said Parker. “Or maybe they can meet up with their group before a workout, or if they want a place to hang out with their friends after a workout, they have it.”\nWhile the Marietta rec center is open, the total renovation isn’t complete. There are still plans to add a climbing gym as well as replace the basketball floor surface, update the goals in the two-court gym, and add a pickleball court, badminton lines, and a walking track around the courts.\n“These are all things students have been asking for,” Parker said. “We are excited to see that come to fruition.”\nBooth said she is confident students will like the changes in the renovated rec center.\n“I hope students feel like they have this place to go to get away from it all — class, studying, all the homework – and make themselves and their well-being a priority,” she said.\n– By Amanda Cook\nPhotos by Matt Yung\n\n\n\n\nRelated StoriesRecord Kennesaw State football crowd reflects student-engagement successMarching Owls take advantage of transitional football season for Kennesaw StateFun programs have serious purpose to engage Kennesaw State studentsKennesaw State leaders welcome faculty and staff for new academic yearA leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 43,000 students.

Through this unique collaborative effort, we have seen our students investigate truly impactful topics that only serve to benefit their growth as researchers.”\nWorking in Suppiramaniam's laboratory, Moerschel theorized the use of tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC, among pregnant people led to memory and learning issues in children via specific receptors in the brain. By exposing rats to THC and then putting them through mazes and other learning experiments, Moerschel discovered that the drug affected the rats’ learning. She added that little research on prenatal THC exposure exists and that it’s a field ripe for discovery.\n“We’re hoping to create some groundbreaking research on THC because currently there’s only research on how cocaine affects those specific receptors,” she said. “We’re looking to educate the public on how ingesting marijuana during pregnancy can affect children and lead to the rising autism rates we see today.”\nIn the spring, the College of Science and Mathematics (CSM) selected 12 students to each receive a $4,000 stipend to pursue research during a summer program established by Birla Carbon, a worldwide chemical manufacturer. \nThe 12 scholars were chosen based on the recommendations of faculty members, submission\n                     of an undergraduate research project abstract, and a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Recipients\n                     worked with their sponsoring faculty members on their proposed research projects in\n                     six departments within CSM.\nThis year’s scholars, their majors and faculty mentors included:\n\nFaith Arends, biology, mentored by Ramya Rajagopolan, assistant professor of cell biology\nSarah Chang, biology, mentored by Graham Collier, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry\nElizabeth Ehme, mathematics, mentored by Eric Stachura, assistant professor of mathematics\nMahdi Ghasemi, biology, mentored by Mohammad Abdul Halim, assistant professor of chemistry and\n                        biochemistry\nBenjamin Gibbas, chemistry, mentored by Michael Stollenz, associate professor of inorganic chemistry\nDarmon Kahvazadeh, biology, mentored by Clint Penick, assistant professor of biology\nIra Menich, chemistry, Graham Collier, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry\nAbby Moen, biology, Marina Koether, professor of chemistry\nKatie Moerschel, biology, Vishnu Suppiramaniam, interim dean and professor of biology\nConnor Muth, chemistry, Mark Mitchell, professor of chemistry and biochemistry\nBenjamin Nguyen, biology, Brandon Carpenter, assistant professor of molecular biology\nMark Sheehan, biology, Christopher Cornelison, associate professor of microbiology\n\nSince 2014, funds provided by Birla Carbon have enabled 93 Birla Carbon Scholars to\n                     participate in research. This year marks the 10th cohort of scholars, and Birla Carbon\n                     recently reaffirmed its pledge to the program by extending the agreement for another\n                     five years and adding $325,000 to the commitment. Birla Carbon CEO John Loudermilk\n                     said the company looks forward to the continued partnership as well as the Symposium,\n                     a yearly event to showcase young scientists.\n“After many years, the partnership between Birla Carbon and Kennesaw State University remains successful and has reached an unprecedented maturity level,” Loudermilk said. “Our Birla Scholars Program is one example, as many students from the College of Science and Mathematics apply each summer. To see the popularity and support from all is fulfilling in every sense.”\nAlong with the $4,000 stipend each scholar received, Moerschel received an additional $2,000 in travel funds to present her research at a national or regional conference. \nAbout Birla Carbon\nBirla Carbon is the world’s largest producer and supplier of carbon black additives, which are used to make everything from tires to plastics, from paints to electronics. A flagship business of the $45 billion Aditya Birla Group, the multinational conglomerate based in Taloja, India, Birla Carbon’s Technology Laboratories are located in Marietta and Taloja, India.\n– Dave Shelles\nPhotos by Judith Pishnery\n\n\n\n\nRelated StoriesKennesaw State biology professor will create research opportunities through NIH grantKennesaw State graduate's national security and data analysis interests lead to defense jobKennesaw State and Cobb County partnership pioneers new mental health 911 response Kennesaw State student finds direction in chemistry with Double-Owl programA leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 43,000 students.
